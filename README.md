# Handwritten-Digits-Recognition

 The MNIST datset consist of handwritten digits as grayscale images where each image is of 28 by 28 pixels.
 The image have been normalized to fit at the center of the boundary box.
 The dataset consist of a set of 60,000 images in the training data set and a set of 10,000 images as testing data
 set.
 The task is to train a model to predict the labels of a handwritten digits from the dataset
 The output of the model is a set of confidence levels for each digit from 0 - 9.
 Our goal is to train the model such that we can predict the digits with a high level of
 confidence
